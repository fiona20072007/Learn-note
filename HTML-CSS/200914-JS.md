# JS Basics

```js
alert("Hello. Thanks for visiting!");
console.log("Hello from the console.");
document.write("<h1>Welcome to my web page.</h1>");
var firstName = prompt("first name?");
```

JS Engine: A program (or interpreter) built into the browser that execute JS code.

```md
<script src="js/script.js"></script>

// link to near the bottom of the html page
```

Browsers run JavaScript code as soon as they encounter it. Putting the code after the page content assures that the page will display before the program runs.

In JS, strings are not only type of data, they're also objects that have properties (ex: length). property is like variable that store value.

methods can use on object (ex: toUpperCase()).

```js
const name = prompt("Hi");
```

string concatenation: the process of combining two or more strings into a single string.

template literal: interpolation

```js
const name = prompt("name?");
const message = `<h2>Hello, ${name}.
It's ${2 * 3} o'clock.</h2>`;

document.querySelector("main").innerHTML = message;

/*
document is a built in object, querySelector is a method that access main element in index.html file, innerHTML is a property that replace the existing contents of an element with new content.
*/
```
