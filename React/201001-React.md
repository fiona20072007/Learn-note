```js
const title = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "main-title", title: "This is an title." },
  "my first React element title"
);

const desc = React.createElement("p", null, "my first React element");
```

React does not create actual DOM nodes(actual h1, div, span). For instance, the title element we defined is not a real h1 element. It's actually an object that describes a DOM node. It's an object representation of a DOM node.

The elements that React creates are actually plain JavaScript objects that describe the element you'd like to display to your UI.

```js
ReactDOM.render(title, document.getElementById("root"));
```

This is the function that actually does the creating and updating of the DOM. It's what connects React to the DOM.

The React code we write in app.js will be rendered into this root div. Or in React terms, this is where we will be mounting our React application. Any existing DOM elements inside the root div will be replaced when render is first called. So everything inside the root DOM element gets managed by ReactDOM.render.

You can provide the children as any number of arguments after the props argument. createElement considers anything after the second argument as children.

React never touches the actual DOM directly. It just manages what gets rendered to the DOM and what gets updated via reactDOM.render. It's not until render that the browser creates actual DOM elements like our header and its children. So in other words, it's renders job to interpret the element objects and create DOM nodes out of them.

React only manages what gets rendered to the DOM via ReactDOM.render. It's the job of render() to interpret the element objects and create DOM nodes out of them.

JSX is an extension to the JavaScript language that uses a markup-like syntax to create React elements.

Now JSX still produces objects that describe a DOM node.

Since JSX is an extension to the JS language, it accepts any valid JavaScript expressions written inside curly braces.

```js
const title = "my first React element";
const desc = "Hi";
const name = "main-title";

const header = (
  <header>
    {/*this is comment*/}
    <h1 className={name}>{title}</h1>
    <p>{desc}</p>
  </header>
);
```

When you use curly braces in JSX, it's called a JSX expression.

A component is a piece of UI that you can reuse. Just like you're able to reuse code in JavaScript with functions, a component lets you reuse code that renders a part of your UI. Being able to split your UI code into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation is one the most embraced features of React.
